# Understanding Nested if Statements

### Summary
In this lab, you complete a prewritten Java program that calculates an employee’s productivity bonus and prints the employee’s name and bonus.

Bonuses are calculated based on an employee’s productivity score as shown below. 

A productivity score is calculated by first dividing an employee’s transactions dollar value by the number of transactions and then dividing the result by the number of shifts worked.

Productivity Score | Bonus
----------------- | -----
\<=30 | $50
31–69 | $75
70–199 | $100
\>= 200 | $200

##### Instructions
Ensure the file named EmployeeBonus.java is open.

Variables have been declared for you, and the input statements and output statements have been written. Read them over carefully before you proceed to the next step.

Design the logic, and write the rest of the program using a nested if statement.

Execute the program by clicking Run and enter the following as input:

```
Employee’s first name: Kim Smith  
Number of shifts: 25  
Number of transactions: 75  
Transaction dollar value: 40000.00
Your output should be:
Employee Name: Kim Smith  
Employee Bonus: $50.0
