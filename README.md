# CSC-119-Java-MindTap/Cengage
Java code from Cengage coding exercises

### Exercises range from basic user Input/Output to OOP implementation and desgin
Most applications are gutted and the code is more "fill-in-the-blank."

Exercises are compiled in a web-based application.
Main methods have C-style array declaration: 
```
public static void main(String args[])
```
If an error or warning shows in a Java IDE, change the array declaration to Java.
```
public static void main(String[] args)
```
