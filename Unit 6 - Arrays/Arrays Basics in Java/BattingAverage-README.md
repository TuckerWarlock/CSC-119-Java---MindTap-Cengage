# Array Basics

### Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially prewritten Java program that uses an array.

The program prompts the user to interactively enter eight batting averages, which the program stores in an array. 
The program should then find the minimum and maximum batting average stored in the array as well as the average of the eight batting averages. The data file provided for this lab includes the input statement and some variable declarations. 
Comments are included in the file to help you write the remainder of the program.

#### Instructions
1. Ensure the file named **BattingAverage.java** is open.

2. Write the Java statements as indicated by the comments.

3. Execute the program by clicking "Run Code." 
Enter the following batting averages: **.299, .157, .242, .203, .198, .333, .270, .190.** 
The minimum batting average should be .157, and the maximum batting average should be .333. 
The average should be **.2365.**
