# Searching an Array for an Exact Match

### Summary
In this lab, you use what you have learned about searching an array to find an exact match to complete a partially prewritten Java program. 
The program uses an array that contains valid names for 10 cities in Michigan. 
You ask the user of the program to enter a city name; your program then searches the array for that city name. 
If it is not found, the program should print a message that informs the user the city name is not found in the list of valid cities in Michigan. 
The data file provided for this lab includes the input statements and the necessary variable declarations. 
You need to use a loop to examine all the items in the array and test for a match. 
You also need to set a flag if there is a match, and then test the flag variable to determine if you should print the **"Not a city in Michigan"** message. 
Comments in the code tell you where to write your statements.

#### Instructions
1. Study the prewritten code to make sure you understand it.
2. Write a loop statement that examines the names of cities stored in the array.
3. Write code that tests for a match.
4. Write code that, when appropriate, prints the message: **"Not a city in Michigan.".**
5. Execute the program using the following as input:


```
Chicago
Brooklyn
Watervliet
Acme
```
