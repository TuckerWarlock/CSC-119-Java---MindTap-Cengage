# Parallel Arrays

### Summary
In this lab, you use what you have learned about parallel arrays to complete a partially completed Java program. 
The program should either print the name and price for a coffee add-in from the Jumpinâ€™ Jive coffee shop or it should print the message: 
**"Sorry, we do not carry that.".** 
Read the problem description carefully before you begin. 
The data file provided for this lab includes the necessary variable declarations and input statements. 
You need to write the part of the program that searches for the name of the coffee add-in(s) and either prints the name and price of the add-in or prints the error message if the add-in is not found.

#### Instructions

2. Write the code that searches the array for the name of the add-in ordered by the customer.
3. Write the code that prints the name and price of the add-in or the error message, and also write the code that prints the total order cost.
4. Execute the program using the following data:
