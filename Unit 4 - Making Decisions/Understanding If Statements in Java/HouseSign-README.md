# Understanding If Statements

### Summary
In this lab, you complete a prewritten Java program for a carpenter who creates personalized house signs. 
The program is supposed to compute the price of any sign a customer orders, based on the following facts:

* The charge for all signs is a minimum of $35.00.
* The first five letters or numbers are included in the minimum charge; there is a $4 charge for each additional character.
* If the sign is made of oak, add $20.00. No charge is added for pine.
* Black or white characters are included in the minimum charge; there is an additional $15 charge for gold-leaf lettering.

##### Instructions
1. Ensure the file named **HouseSign.java** is open.

2. You need to declare variables for the following, and initialize them where specified:
    * A variable for the cost of the sign initialized to 0.00 (charge).
    * A variable for the number of characters initialized to 8 (numChars).
    * A variable for the color of the characters initialized to "gold" (color).
    * A variable for the wood type initialized to "oak" (woodType).

3. Write the rest of the program using assignment statements and if statements as appropriate. The output statements are written for you.

4. Execute the program by clicking Run. Your output should be: **The charge for this sign is $82.**
