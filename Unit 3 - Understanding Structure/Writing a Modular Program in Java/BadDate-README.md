# Writing a Modular Program in Java

### Summary
In this lab, you add the input and output statements to a partially completed Java program. 
When completed, the user should be able to enter a year, a month, 
and a day to determine if the date is valid. 
Valid years are those that are greater than 0, 
valid months include the values 1 through 12, and valid days include the values 1 through 31.

> Instructions:
1. Notice that variables have been declared for you.
2. Write the simulated housekeeping() method that contains input statements to retrieve a year, a month, and a day from the user.
3. Add statements to the simulated housekeeping() method that convert the String representation of the year, month, and day to ints.
4. Include the output statements in the simulated endOfJob() method. The format of the output is as follows:
```
month/day/year is a valid date.
or
month/day/year is an invalid date.
```
5. Execute the program entering the following date:
```
month = 5, day = 32, year =2014
```
Observe the output of this program.
6. Execute the program entering the following date:
```
month = 9, day = 21, year = 2002
```
Observe the output of this program.
