# Nesting Loops

### Summary
In this lab, you add nested loops to a Java program provided. 
The program should print the letter **E**. The letter E is printed using asterisks, three across and five down. 
Note that this program uses ```System.out.print("*");``` to print an asterisk without a new line.

#### Instructions
1. Write the nested loops to control the number of rows and the number of columns that make up the letter **E.**
2. In the loop body, use a nested ```if``` statement to decide when to print an asterisk and when to print a space. 
The output statements have been written, but you must decide when and where to use them.
3. Execute the program. Observe your output.
4. Modify the program to change the number of rows from five to seven and the number of columns from three to five. What does the letter E look like now?
