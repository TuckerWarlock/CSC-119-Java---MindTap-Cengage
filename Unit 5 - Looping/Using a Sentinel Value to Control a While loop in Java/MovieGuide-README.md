# Using a Sentinel Value to Control a ```while``` Loop

### Summary
In this lab, you write a ```while``` loop that uses a sentinel value to control a loop in a Java program that has been provided. 
You also write the statements that make up the body of the loop.

The source code file already contains the necessary variable declarations and output statements. 
Each theater patron enters a value from 0 to 4 indicating the number of stars the patron awards to the Guideâ€™s featured movie of the week. 
The program executes continuously until the theater manager enters a negative number to quit. 
At the end of the program, you should display the average star rating for the movie.

##### Instructions
1. Ensure the file named **MovieGuide.java** is open.

2. Write the while loop using a sentinel value to control the loop, and write the statements that make up the body of the loop to calculate the average star rating.

3. Execute the program by clicking ***Run.***

4. Input the following: **0, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, -1**

5. Check that the average output is correct.
