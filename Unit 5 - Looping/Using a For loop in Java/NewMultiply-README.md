# Using a ```for``` Loop

### Summary
In this lab the completed program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied by 2 and by 10. 
You should accomplish this using a ```for``` loop instead of a counter-controlled ```while``` loop.

#### Instructions
1. Write a ```for``` loop that uses the loop control variable to take on the values 0 through 10.
2. In the body of the loop, multiply the value of the loop control variable by 2 and by 10.
3. Execute the program. Is the output the same?
