# Using a ```do while``` Loop

### Summary
In this lab, you work with the same Java program you worked with in Labs 5-1 and 5-3. 
As in those earlier labs, the completed program should print the numbers 0 through 10, along with their values multiplied by 2 and by 10. However, in this lab you should accomplish this using a ```do while``` loop.

#### Instructions
1. Ensure the file named **NewestMultiply.java** is open.

2. Write a ```do while``` loop that uses the loop control variable to take on the values 0 through 10.

3. In the body of the loop, multiply the value of the loop control variable by 2 and by 10.

4. Execute the program by clicking **Run** and verify that the output is correct.
