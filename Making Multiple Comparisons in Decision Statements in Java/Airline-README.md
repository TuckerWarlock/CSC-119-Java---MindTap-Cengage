# Making Multiple Comparisons in Decision Statements

### Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially written Java program for an airline that offers a 25 percent discount to passengers who are 6 years old or younger and the same discount to passengers who are 65 years old or older. 
The program should request a passengerâ€™s name and age and then print whether the passenger is eligible or not eligible for a discount.

##### Instructions
1. Ensure the file named Airline.java is open.

2. Variables have been declared and initialized for you, and the input statements have been written. 
Read them carefully before you proceed to the next step.

3. Design the logic deciding whether to use AND or OR logic. 
Write the decision statement to identify when a discount should be offered and when a discount should not be offered.

4. Be sure to include output statements telling whether or not the customer is eligible for a discount.

5. Execute the program by clicking Run and enter the following as input, and verify the outputs are correct:

```
