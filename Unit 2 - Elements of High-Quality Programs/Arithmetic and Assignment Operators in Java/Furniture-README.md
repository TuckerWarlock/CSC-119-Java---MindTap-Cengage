# Understanding Operator Precedence and Associativity

### Summary
In this lab, you complete a partially written Java program that is provided for you. 
The program, which was written for a furniture company, prints the name of the furniture item, 
its retail price, its wholesale price, the profit made on the piece of furniture, 
a sale price, and the profit made when the sale price is used.

> Instructions:
1. Ensure the file named Furniture.java is open.
2. The file includes variable declarations and output statements. Read them carefully before you proceed to the next step.
3. Design the logic and write the Java code that will use assignment statements to:
4. Calculate the profit (profit) as the retail price minus the wholesale price
5. Calculate the sale price (salePrice) as 25 percent deducted from the retail price
6. Calculate the sale profit (saleProfit) as the sale price minus the wholesale price.
7. Execute the program by clicking Run. Your output should be as follows:
```
Item Name: TV Stand
Retail Price: $325
Wholesale Price: $200
Profit: $125 
Sale Price: $243.75
Sale Profit: $43.75
```
