# Understanding If-Else Statements in Java

### Summary
In this lab, you will complete a prewritten Java program that computes the largest and smallest of three integer values. 
The three values are **–50, 53, and 78.**

##### Instructions
* Two variables named largest and smallest are declared for you. 
* Use these variables to store the largest and smallest of the three integer values. 
* You must decide what other variables you will need and initialize them if appropriate.

Write the rest of the program using assignment statements, if statements, or if-else statements as appropriate. 
There are comments in the code that tell you where you should write your statements. 
The output statement is written for you.
Execute the program. Your output should be:

```
The largest value is 78
```

```
The smallest value is −50
